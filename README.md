# ChatGPT Conversations Data Visualization

This project visualizes data from my ChatGPT conversations and categorizes the conversation titles into different topics using **Hugging Face's Zero-Shot Classification** model. Inspired by **Chip Huyen's** repository, which used ChatGPT conversations to create a heatmap visualizing new conversations started, I decided to track the **number of chats** I’ve had with ChatGPT to visualize my activeness. Additionally, I extracted the conversation titles and categorized them, giving insight into the diversity of topics discussed.

## Features:
- **Chat Activity Heatmap**: Visualizes the number of messages exchanged with ChatGPT over the days, categorized by year. This shows the activeness of interactions over time.
- **Conversation Categorization**: Extracts the titles of conversations and categorizes them into predefined topics such as **Technology & Programming**, **Productivity & Self-Improvement**, **Education & Study Help**, etc., using the Hugging Face Zero-Shot Classification model.
- **Visualization**: Generates a horizontal bar chart to show the count of conversations in each category.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python** 
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and generating heatmaps and bar charts.
- **Hugging Face**: For the Zero-Shot Classification model used to categorize conversation titles.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (optional): For interactive analysis and visualizations.

## Getting Started:
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/hchamikadilshan/ChatGPT-ConversationsData-Visualization.git
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the project:
   - You can use the provided code to extract your ChatGPT conversation data (ensure the data is in the required format).
   - Visualize the heatmap of your ChatGPT activity over time.
   - Categorize your conversation titles using the Hugging Face Zero-Shot Classification model and generate insightful visualizations.

## Example Output:
1. **Heatmap of ChatGPT Activity**: A heatmap of daily conversation activity, broken down by year.

2. **Categorization of Conversations**: A bar chart showing the number of conversations under each category.

## Future Improvements:
- Expand the conversation categories to cover more topics.
- Create more detailed visualizations, such as word clouds or topic clustering.
- Automate data extraction from ChatGPT logs for better integration.
