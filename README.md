# ChatGPT Conversations Data Visualization

This project visualizes data from my ChatGPT conversations and categorizes the conversation titles into different topics using **Hugging Face's Zero-Shot Classification** model. Inspired by **Chip Huyen's** repository, which used ChatGPT conversations to create a heatmap visualizing new conversations started, I decided to track the **number of chats** Iâ€™ve had with ChatGPT to visualize my activeness. Additionally, I extracted the conversation titles and categorized them, giving insight into the diversity of topics discussed.

## Features:
- **Chat Activity Heatmap**: Visualizes the number of messages exchanged with ChatGPT over the days, categorized by year. This shows the activeness of interactions over time.
- **Conversation Categorization**: Extracts the titles of conversations and categorizes them into predefined topics such as **Technology & Programming**, **Productivity & Self-Improvement**, **Education & Study Help**, etc., using the Hugging Face Zero-Shot Classification model.
- **Visualization**: Generates a horizontal bar chart to show the count of conversations in each category.

## Technologies Used:
- **Python** 
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib**: For visualizing data and generating heatmaps and bar charts.
- **Hugging Face**: For the Zero-Shot Classification model used to categorize conversation titles.
- **Jupyter Notebooks** (optional): For interactive analysis and visualizations.

## Getting Started:
1. Export your ChatGPT conversation data as `conversations.json`.
2. Place the `conversations.json` file inside the `data/` folder in the repository.

   **File structure example:**
   ```
   ChatGPT-ConversationsData-Visualization/
   â”œâ”€â”€ data/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ conversations.json  <- Your exported ChatGPT conversations file
   â”œâ”€â”€ notebooks/
   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ 1 - Creating Heat maps.ipynb  <- Jupyter notebook for analysis
   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
   â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
   â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
   ```

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 2: Install Dependencies**  
Run the following command to install the required dependencies:  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### ðŸ”¹ **Step 3: Run the Notebook**  
Open the Jupyter notebook inside the `notebooks/` folder and run the analysis:

```bash
jupyter notebook "notebooks/1 - Creating Heat maps.ipynb"
```

This will generate insights and visualizations based on your conversations.



## Example Output:
1. **Heatmap of ChatGPT Activity**: A heatmap of daily conversation activity, broken down by year.

2. **Categorization of Conversations**: A bar chart showing the number of conversations under each category.

## Future Improvements:
- Expand the conversation categories to cover more topics.
- Create more detailed visualizations, such as word clouds or topic clustering.
- Automate data extraction from ChatGPT logs for better integration.
